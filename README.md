# Frontend Course Assignments (10 Weeks)

This repository contains all the assignments from a 10-week frontend development course. The course starts with the core principles of JavaScript and builds up to modern frontend development with React. Each week is designed to deepen understanding through hands-on exercises, challenges, and a final capstone project that brings everything together.

## 💡 Purpose

This repository is more than just a collection of weekly assignments — it represents a personal journey of growth and learning in frontend development. From writing the first lines of JavaScript to building a fully functional React app, this repo captures the steady progression of skills, confidence, and problem-solving ability.

The assignments were completed as part of a structured course, but they've been carefully organized and documented so that others can benefit from them too — whether you're a beginner looking for guided practice or just curious to see how concepts evolve over time.
